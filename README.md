# Critical-points-of-a-function-via-genetic-algorithm
This code uses a genetic algoritm to search graphically for critical points of any contiuous function.
In the first section of the code you can choose any function between an interval [a,b], the quantity of muestras and iterations of SEARCH should be changed accord of the complexity of the function.
